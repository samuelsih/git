# GIT

## Description
A repo that modifies [this github source](https://github.com/sosedoff/gitkit). 

## Why 
1. I want to use [this github source](https://github.com/sosedoff/gitkit) but it is really hard to extend the event.
2. I dont want to use all the features (i.e hooks).
3. Modifies the code to my personal style.
